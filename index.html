            <p class="p__opensans">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Management & Operations (M&O) Contract to National TRU Solutions, LLC (NTS), a joint venture led by HII Nuclear Inc., part of Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Technical Solutions division, with partner Atkins Nuclear Secured, LLC; and subcontractors New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, the Trustees of the Colorado School of Mines, North Wind Dynamics, LLC, and SE&C, LLC. The contract has a ten-year ordering period with a value of $3.5 billion.</p>
            <blockquote><p class="p__opensans">We look forward to supporting the Department of Energy on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Management & Operations Contract,” said Michael Lempke, president of HII Technical Solutions’ Nuclear and Environmental business group. “We have assembled a tremendous team of highly qualified leaders, and we look forward to performing with distinction on this project for DOE with the talented WIPP workforce, regulators and stakeholders.</p></blockquote>
            <p class="p__opensans">The majority of the work will be conducted at the WIPP Site located approximately 32 miles from Carlsbad, New Mexico.  WIPP is a 2,150 feet deep geologic repository and is the only repository in the nation for permanent disposal of transuranic (TRU) waste that is the byproduct of the nation's nuclear defense program.  The WIPP Land Withdrawal Act was passed by Congress in 1992 and waste disposal began in 1999.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Under the new contract, NTS will manage, operate and maintain the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and perform activities in support of the DOE’s National Transuranic (TRU) Waste Program (NTP) at DOE generator sites across the country. The overall objectives of WIPP are to operate safely and dispose of TRU waste, in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment and in compliance with WIPP program requirements and support the NTP by providing safe and compliant characterization and certification for transport, receipt, and disposal of TRU wastes at WIPP.</p>
