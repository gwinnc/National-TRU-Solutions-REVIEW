            <p class="p__opensans">Our commitment to small business participation on the WIPP M&O program is evident in both our history of award-winning small business process accolades and demonstrated ability to exceed small business participation requirements. This commitment is embedded in our corporate culture and begins on Day One.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">To advance small business participation and exceed the contract requirement for small business subcontracting, we use a proven three-step approach.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 1. Implement a procurement process that maximizes specific and meaningful prospects for small businesses, streamlines the award process, and tracks performance with our goals.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 2. Enhance the small businesses outreach program to seek and expand the pool of qualified small businesses to bid on task order subcontracted scope, especially among local and regional small businesses.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 3. Implement a mentor-protégé program, based on our successes on other contracts, to develop and strengthen small business capabilities.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">This approach incorporates lessons learned from our DOE award-winning small business programs at the Savannah River Site Maintenance & Operations contract, Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup contract, Hanford Tank Operations Contract and Hanford Central Plateau Cleanup contract. Based on our projected subcontracting scope, we will exceed the total contract value goal for small businesses by at least 25%. Our Business Manager oversees our small business program and assigns a small business advocate to implement our plan.</p>
