            <h2 class="app__subheading p__cormorant p__upper" style="margin-top: 1rem;">SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING</h2>
            <p class="p__opensans">Our commitment to small business participation on the WIPP M&O program is evident in both our history of award-winning small business process accolades and demonstrated ability to exceed small business participation requirements. This commitment is embedded in our corporate culture and begins on Day One.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">To advance small business participation and exceed the contract requirement for small business subcontracting, we use a proven three-step approach.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 1. Implement a procurement process that maximizes specific and meaningful prospects for small businesses, streamlines the award process, and tracks performance with our goals.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 2. Enhance the small businesses outreach program to seek and expand the pool of qualified small businesses to bid on task order subcontracted scope, especially among local and regional small businesses.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">Step 3. Implement a mentor-protégé program, based on our successes on other contracts, to develop and strengthen small business capabilities.</p>
            <p class="p__opensans">This approach incorporates lessons learned from our DOE award-winning small business programs at the Savannah River Site Maintenance & Operations contract, Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup contract, Hanford Tank Operations Contract and Hanford Central Plateau Cleanup contract. Based on our projected subcontracting scope, we will exceed the total contract value goal for small businesses by at least 25%. Our Business Manager oversees our small business program and assigns a small business advocate to implement our plan.</p>

<p class="p__opensans">National TRU Solutions, LLC (NTS) is committed to the safe, secure, and compliant delivery of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Management and Operating contract mission, which includes supporting and strengthening local communities. NTS and its parent companies are committed to the continuous improvement and transformation of our communities. Our community commitments focus on creating educational initiatives that support workforce development, forming partnerships with regional vendors and small businesses, promoting Environmental Justice per the President’s priorities, and helping local community service organizations. Managing WIPP operations provides NTS the opportunity to support regional programs that expand workforce skills and strengthen the local economy.</p>
<p class="p__opensans">Having a trained and ready local workforce is vital to successful delivery of the WIPP mission. NTS is uniquely qualified in the state of New Mexico (NM) to bring a first-of-its-kind educational program to southeastern NM. We will accomplish this in collaboration with our Workforce Development and Innovation Advisory Group by expanding the Nuclear Operator Apprentice School and Boot Camp training programs developed by our affiliate, Newport News Nuclear BWXT–Los Alamos, for the Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup Contract (LLCC), executed in partnership with Northern New Mexico College.</p>
